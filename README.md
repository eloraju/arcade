# [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/)

Just some gamedev training for myself :)  
I might write a devlog in the future or not.

Pressing `Esc` toggles the game menu and pressing `Tab` in a game toggles the game menu (if one exists)

## Game list

1. [Pong](#game-1-pång-pong)
2. [Jetpack joyride](#game-2-jetpack-joyride)
3. [Global todo](#global-todo)

## Game 1: PÅNG (PONG)

### Controls

| Button       | Action            |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| <kbd>W</kbd> | Left paddle up    |
| <kbd>S</kbd> | Left paddle down  |
| <kbd>-</kbd> | Right paddle up   |
| <kbd>-</kbd> | Right paddle down |

### TODO

- [ ] Two player controls
- Currently <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd> control both paddles at once. Adding controls for second player is trivial, but I'm lazy :smile:
- [ ] Single player AI

## Game 2: Jetpack joyride

### Controls

| Button           | Action  |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Move up |

### TODO

- [ ] Everything

### Devlog

If there's going to be one, it's going to live here

## Global todo

- [ ] Rebindable keys
